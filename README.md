Through these data science projects, I've honed my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and Python programming. I've gained proficiency in data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. I've delved into various machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, gradient boosting, and recommendation systems. Additionally, I've explored techniques for model explainability and feature engineering to improve model performance. Indeed, these projects have allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
